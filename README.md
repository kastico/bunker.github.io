## The Bunker
Welcome to my personal portfolio and blog!

This space is where I showcase my projects, experiments, and creative work, while also sharing weekly posts about topics I’m exploring and learning about. My goal is to create a living record of my journey — both the successes and the lessons learned along the way.


- **Portfolio:** Here you’ll find a collection of my projects, from small experiments to larger personal or collaborative work.
    
- **Blog:** Every week I write about topics that excite me — new technologies, design insights, personal growth, or tutorials.
    

This isn’t just a showcase of what I’ve done, but a way to reflect on **what I’m learning**, and hopefully inspire others along the way.
